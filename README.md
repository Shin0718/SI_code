# Test code for WanderPal

# Step1
# Install dependencies as needed:
# pip install kagglehub[pandas-datasets]
import kagglehub
from kagglehub import KaggleDatasetAdapter

# Set the path to the file you'd like to load
file_path = ""

# Load the latest version
df = kagglehub.load_dataset(
  KaggleDatasetAdapter.PANDAS,
  "shinchen2/1822-a",
  file_path,
  # Provide any additional arguments like 
  # sql_query or pandas_kwargs. See the 
  # documenation for more information:
  # https://github.com/Kaggle/kagglehub/blob/main/README.md#kaggledatasetadapterpandas
)

print("First 5 records:", df.head())

# Step2
# Train-model.ipynb is used to train the curb dataset

# Step3
# Run the transfer.ipynb file using the trained model to output the motor number (I provided a trained model file named best. pt)
